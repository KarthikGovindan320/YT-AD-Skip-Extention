# YT-AD-Skip-Extension

## Overview
It's a cruel world out there if you don't have YouTube Premium.  
You're often forced to watch **2 or even 3 ads** before your video starts — and sometimes, ads interrupt at the worst possible moments.

Most traditional ad blockers no longer work reliably, as YouTube has started detecting and blocking them.  
In response to this growing need for a functional and undetectable workaround, I developed this **lightweight browser extension**.

## Key Concept
- This is **not an ad blocker** in the traditional sense — and that’s what makes it work.
- Put both of the code files under a folder named "AdBlocker". Upload that folder as your extentention folder into your browser.
- For reference : https://chatgpt.com/share/681088de-4c4c-8012-9551-14ff8a5333a7

### How It Works:
- Detects when an ad is playing.
- Sets the **playback speed to 100x** (actually 16x which is the maximum, but basically instant either way), causing the ad to finish "naturally" in under a second.
- Resumes normal playback immediately after the ad.

Because the extension doesn’t block ads but speeds them up instead, it avoids triggering YouTube's anti-ad-blocker measures.

## Additional Feature: Playback Speed Unlocker
This extension also acts as a **playback speed extender**:
- YouTube normally limits non-premium users to **2x playback speed**.
- With this extension, you can go **beyond 2x**, giving you full control over video speed.

## Features
- Undetectable by YouTube’s ad-blocker detection system.
- Works seamlessly on all videos, without interrupting functionality.
- Lightweight and efficient — minimal performance impact.
- Customizable maximum playback speed.

## Requirements
- Compatible Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Brave). Opera works too.
- Extension must be loaded in developer mode (or packed and installed manually).

Since there is little hope in this getting aproved into google chrome's extention list, for the time being, one has to manually upload the extention package as a developer.
